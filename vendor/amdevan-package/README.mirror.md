# amdevan/package (vendor mirror)

This folder is prepared to store files fetched from the GitHub repository:

- Repository: https://github.com/amdevan/package
- Branch: main

You can place retrieved files here and import them in the project as needed.

Examples:
- Save `components/Button.tsx` as `vendor/amdevan-package/components/Button.tsx`
- Save `constants.ts` as `vendor/amdevan-package/constants.ts`

After saving, import from `vendor/amdevan-package/...` or copy into `src/` if the code needs to be part of the build pipeline.
